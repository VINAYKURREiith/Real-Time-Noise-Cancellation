# Real-Time Noise Cancellation using LMS, NLMS, and RLS

This project is part of the EE2800 – Digital Signal Processing course at IIT Hyderabad. It implements adaptive filters to cancel noise from speech signals in real time. The final design leverages the **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)** algorithm for its superior convergence and noise suppression performance.

---

##  Problem Overview

Design a **programmable, selective noise canceller** that:

- Uses external noise measurements \( w(n) \) and noisy speech \( s(n) + v(n) \)
- Estimates and subtracts the leakage noise \( \hat{v}(n) \)
- Works in both:
  - **Full suppression mode**: cancels all external noise
  - **Partial suppression mode**: cancels only non-tonal noise

##  Algorithms Implemented

- **LMS (Least Mean Squares)**: Simple, slow convergence  
- **NLMS (Normalized LMS)**: Scaled adaptation, moderate convergence  
- **RLS (Recursive Least Squares)**: Fastest convergence, lowest steady-state error

The RLS algorithm was selected for the final system.

##  Design Insights (from Experiments)

###  Filter Order (M)
![SNR vs Filter Order](./images/filter%20order.jpg)  
**Best performance at M = 13**

###  Forgetting Factor (λ)
![SNR vs Forgetting Factor](./images/forgetting%20factor.jpg)  
**Optimal λ = 1**, yields best balance between memory and responsiveness

###  Initialization Parameter (Δ)

**Best Δ ~ 3.79×10⁻¹³** achieves highest SNR gain

##  RLS Algorithm Details

- **Error Function**:  
  \( E(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \lambda^{n-i} e^2(i) \), where \( e(i) = d(i) - w_n^T x(i) \)

- **Weight Update**:  
  \( w_n = w_{n-1} + g(n)\alpha(n) \)

- **Gain Vector**:  
  \( g(n) = \frac{P(n)x(n)}{\lambda + x^T(n)P(n)x(n)} \)

- **Error**:  
  \( \alpha(n) = e(n) - w_{n-1}^T x(n) \)

###  Notch Filter for Partial Suppression

Transfer Function:  
\[
H(z) = \frac{1 - 2\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1 - 2r\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + r z^{-2}}
\]

Difference Equation:
\[
y(n) = a_1 y(n-1) - a_2 y(n-2) + b_0 x(n) - b_1 x(n-1) + b_2 x(n-2)
\]
